## Description

ZAPP! is a mobile application designed to help users understand, calculate, and analyze household electricity usage in a simple and structured way.  
By allowing users to organize their home into rooms and assign electrical appliances to each room, ZAPP! provides accurate estimations of electricity consumption based on real usage patterns.

The application records and visualizes electricity usage over daily, monthly, and yearly periods, enabling users to monitor trends and identify areas of excessive energy consumption.  
Through these insights, users are encouraged to make informed decisions to reduce unnecessary electricity usage and optimize energy efficiency in their homes.

In addition to calculation and monitoring features, ZAPP! also aims to raise awareness about sustainable energy practices.  
By presenting clear data and historical comparisons, the app helps users understand the impact of their daily habits on overall energy consumption, supporting a more responsible and eco-friendly lifestyle.
